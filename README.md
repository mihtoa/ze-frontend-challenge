# ze-frontend-challenge

Hello! Nice to see you here :smile:

This project is a frontend challenge requested by a Zé Delivery job application for Frontend Engineer position.

## Instructions

Use de following address to test: "Rua Ricardo Lunardelli, 123, 04719-070, São Paulo" (the other address from the test instructions is returning an empty array).

## The challenge

The user needs to type an address inside a field and be redirected to a products list page. So your job as a front-end engineer will be to create 2 simple screens consuming and sending data to our API.

You can check out an example of this flow at: https://ze.delivery/ (our production env).

We want you to feel free to develop the markup the way you want, we have no wireframes or something like that for this task. You will create 2 screens:

- Home page:
  - Needs to have a header, a footer and a input for the user to fill up with the address.
- Products page:
  - We want to see the products as cards, with the product title, price and buttons to add/remove the product.

## Tools

- TypeScript
