- 7 days to send the result
- 2 screens

I profferer start for the initial project structure. So, I did set the packages to build the application and the different environment necessity's. Which are:

- Development: server mode, hot reload, auto open localhost, doesn't compress or transpile the files
- Production: compress and transpile all the files in build time
